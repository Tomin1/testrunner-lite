.SH NAME
testrunner-lite \- generic test executor tool 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B testrunner-lite [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B testrunner-lite 
is a tool for executing test commands. It is designed to be a lightweight 
wrapper for various test harnesses. The tool is driven by input XML file containing the test definitions (suite, set, case, step). Tests are executed as
instructed in the input XML file and the output is written to result XML 
or text file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,  \fB\-\-help\fR
Display short help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR,  \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version and exit
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIFILE\fR,  \fB\-\-file\fR \fIFILE\fR
Input file with test definitions in XML (required)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIFILE\fR,  \fB\-\-output\fR \fIFILE\fR
Output file format; FORMAT can be xml or text (Default xml)
.TP
\fB\-v, -vv\fR,  \fB\-\-verbose\fR[\fB=\fR{\fIINFO\fR|\fIDEBUG\fR}]
Enable verbosity mode; -v and --verbose=INFO are equivalent
outputting INFO, ERROR and WARNING messages. Similarly -vv 
and --verbose=DEBUG are equivalent, outputting also debug 
messages. Default behaviour is silent mode.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fIURL\fR,  \fB\-\-logger\fR=\fIURL\fR
Remote HTTP logger. Log messages are sent to given URL in a HTTP POST message.
URL format is [http://]host[:port][/path/], where host may be a hostname or an IPv4 address.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR,  \fB\-\-syslog\fR 
Enable logging to syslog.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR,  \fB\-\-print-step-output\fR
Output standard streams from test steps.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR,  \fB\-\-automatic\fR 
Enable only automatic tests to be executed
.TP
\fB\-m\fR,  \fB\-\-manual\fR 
Enable only manual tests to be executed
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIFILTER\fR,  \fB\-\-filter\fR=\fIFILTER\fR
Filtering option to select tests (not) to be executed. E.g. '-testcase=bad_test -type=unknown' first disables test case named as bad_test; Next, all tests with type unknown are disabled; The remaining tests will be executed. If filter type is prepended with '-' it is a blacklist filter, '+' or no prefix specifies white list filter. A filter can have multiple values separated by ','. E.g. 'testset=foo,wuz' would execute tests from test sets foo and wuz. 
.TP
\fB\-c\fR,  \fB\-\-ci\fR 
Disable validation of test definition against schema
.TP
\fB\-s\fR,  \fB\-\-semantic\fR 
Enable validation of test definition against stricter (semantics) schema
.TP
\fB\-A\fR,  \fB\-\-validate\-only\fR 
Do only input xml validation, do not execute tests
.TP
\fB\-H\fR,  \fB\-\-no\-hwinfo\fR 
Do not try to obtain hardware information
.TP
\fB\-t\fR [\fIUSER\fR@]\fIADDRESS\fR, \fB\-\-target\fR\=[\fIUSER\fR@]\fIADDRESS\fR
Enable host-based testing. If given, commands are executed from
test control PC (host) side. ADDRESS is the ipv4 adress of the
system under test.

.SH EXIT STATUS
